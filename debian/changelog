xkeyboard-config (0.6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.6.2, no changes needed
    in packaging.
  * debian/README.Debian: Add a note explaining how to use xkeyboard-config.
  * Since binary package is xkb-data, files are installed under
    /etc/X11/xkb-data and not /etc/X11/xkeyboard-config.

xkeyboard-config (0.5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Some packages have a versioned dependency on xlibs, so Replaces
    does not work here.  For the moment, XKB files are moved to
    /etc/X11/xkeyboard-config

xkeyboard-config (0.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Initial upload.  Closes: #274299

    xlibs <-> xkb-data transition.
